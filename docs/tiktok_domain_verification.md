# TikTok Domain Verification Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to verify your domain ownership with TikTok using the Flask application's built-in verification file serving functionality.

## Prerequisites
- A Flask application running with ngrok for local development
- Access to TikTok Developer Portal
- Admin access to manage your domain verification

## Implementation Details
The application includes a dedicated route that automatically serves TikTok verification files. This is implemented in `app/__init__.py`:

```python
@app.route('/tiktok<filename>.txt')
def tiktok_verification(filename):
    """Serve TikTok domain verification file."""
    try:
        file_path = Path(APP_ROOT) / f'tiktok{filename}.txt'
        if file_path.exists():
            return send_file(file_path, mimetype='text/plain')
        else:
            logger.error(f"TikTok verification file not found: {file_path}")
            return 'File not found', 404
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error serving TikTok verification file: {str(e)}")
        return 'Error serving file', 500
```

## Step-by-Step Verification Process

1. **Download Verification File**
   - Log in to your TikTok Developer Portal
   - Navigate to the domain verification section
   - Choose "URL prefix" as the verification method
   - Download the provided verification file (format: `tiktokXXXXXXXX.txt`)

2. **Place Verification File**
   - Place the downloaded `.txt` file in your project's root directory
   - Do not modify the filename
   - Ensure the file has proper read permissions

3. **Configure Domain**
   - In TikTok Developer Portal, enter your domain URL
   - For local development with ngrok: use your ngrok URL (e.g., `https://your-ngrok-subdomain.ngrok-free.app`)
   - For production: use your actual domain

4. **Verify Setup**
   - Access the verification file through your browser:
     ```
     https://your-domain.com/tiktokXXXXXXXX.txt
     ```
   - You should see the content of the verification file
   - If you get a 404 error, check:
     - File placement in root directory
     - Exact filename match
     - File permissions

5. **Complete Verification**
   - Return to TikTok Developer Portal
   - Click the verify button
   - TikTok will attempt to access the verification file
   - Upon successful verification, your domain will be approved

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **File Not Found (404)**
   - Verify the file is in the correct location
   - Check the filename matches exactly
   - Ensure proper file permissions

2. **Server Error (500)**
   - Check application logs for detailed error messages
   - Verify the application has read permissions for the file
   - Ensure the file path is correctly configured

3. **Access Denied**
   - Check CORS configuration
   - Verify ngrok tunnel is active (for local development)
   - Ensure proper file permissions

### Logging
The application logs verification attempts:
- Successful file serving: Logged at INFO level
- File not found: Logged at ERROR level with file path
- Server errors: Logged at ERROR level with exception details

## Security Considerations
- The verification file is served with `text/plain` MIME type
- Route is public but only serves specific TikTok verification files
- Implementation includes error handling and logging
- CORS is properly configured for TikTok domains

## Real-World Example
Here's a successful verification example from our implementation:

### Timeline of Events
```
21:13:27 AEDT - Successful verification (200 OK)
  GET /tiktokgZ3c7Evpb8tg1y5ahvs2nMbe3FAihQfk.txt

20:59:39 AEDT - Initial attempt (404 Not Found)
  HEAD /tiktokHWSpOsXgEfIZHvG4BirK276PxegVLyJE.txt

20:49:00 - 20:47:13 AEDT - Multiple successful checks (200 OK)
  GET /tiktokHWSpOsXgEfIZHvG4BirK276PxegVLyJE.txt
```

### What Worked
1. The Flask route successfully served multiple verification files
2. TikTok was able to access the files through our ngrok tunnel
3. Both HEAD and GET requests were handled properly
4. The implementation handled multiple verification attempts gracefully

### Key Observations
- TikTok makes multiple requests to verify domain ownership
- Both HEAD and GET requests are used in the verification process
- The system successfully handled different verification file names
- Response times were consistently fast (as seen in ngrok logs)

## Additional Notes
- Keep the verification file in place after successful verification
- Update the file if TikTok provides a new one
- For production deployment, ensure the file persists across deployments
